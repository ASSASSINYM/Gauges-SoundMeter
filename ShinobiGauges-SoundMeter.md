# Building an Audio Meter using ShinobiGauges


## Introduction

Ever since the iPhone first came out, the audio meter category of apps has been
very popular. In this blog post you'll learn how to create your own version,
using a ShinobiGauge to display the result.

First of all we'll take a look at how to actually calculate the level from the
microphone, before adding a gauge to display the result.

As ever, all the source code for this project is available on Github at
[github.com/ShinobiControls/ShinobiGauges-SoundMeter](https://github.com/sammyd/ShinobiGauges-SoundMeter).
Feel free to fork it and have a play - I'd love a pull request with any issues
you come across :)
